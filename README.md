Maintainers, any active or inactive maintainer that wants to participate in a community can join

Or

Any active software developer at a technology company can join to participate in this community

## Why?
Being a maintainer can be difficult at times, So this group will allow a safe space where
everyone can learn at help eachother. Join so you can learn and help others with their projects

## Where
Our Discord server is where most if not all communication will take place.
We think that is the best way to chat since it is free and it includes voice channels, etc.
